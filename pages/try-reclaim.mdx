# Try Reclaim Protocol

<Steps>
### Generate verification link

A verification link is a unique URL that allows Reclaim Protocol to verify your ownership of a specific account or piece of information. In this case, we'll use it to verify your Google account.

<div className="flex flex-col gap-4">
<p>Click on the button below to generate a verification link. This link will be used to verify your ownership of a Google account.</p>
<Reclaim/>
</div>

Tip: Make sure you're logged into the correct Google account before proceeding.

### Generate proof on Reclaim app

The above URL will redirect you to the Reclaim app where you can create the proof. A proof is a cryptographic verification that you own or have access to certain information. In this case, it proves that you own the Google account without revealing any sensitive details.

If you encounter any issues at this step:
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection
- Check that you're logged into the correct Google account
- If the app is unresponsive, try closing and reopening it

### Submit proof

Once the proof is generated, click on the `Submit` button in the app to submit the proof. You can check your proof [here](#generate-verification-link).

If the submission fails:
- Verify that you completed the proof generation step successfully
- Check your internet connection
- If the issue persists, try generating a new verification link and starting over

### Try the Reclaim Mobile App

Experience the Reclaim Protocol in action with our interactive mobile app demo:

    height="800px" 
    frameborder="0" 
    scrolling="no"></iframe>

In this demo, you can:
1. Navigate through the app interface
2. Generate a sample proof
3. Submit the proof and see the verification process

Remember, this is a simulation. For a full experience, download the actual Reclaim app on your device.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while trying out Reclaim Protocol, here are some common problems and their solutions:

1. **Verification link not working**: Ensure you're using the latest generated link. Links expire after a certain time for security reasons.

2. **Proof generation fails**: Check your internet connection and make sure you're logged into the correct Google account.

3. **App not responding**: Try closing and reopening the app. If the issue persists, check for app updates.

4. **Submission errors**: Verify that you completed all previous steps correctly. If problems continue, try generating a new verification link and starting the process over.

Remember, Reclaim Protocol is designed to be user-friendly and secure. If you're experiencing persistent issues, don't hesitate to reach out to our support team or consult our comprehensive documentation for more detailed information.

## Next Steps

Now that you've tried out Reclaim Protocol, consider exploring these advanced topics:

1. Integrating Reclaim Protocol into your own applications
2. Understanding the cryptographic principles behind Reclaim's proofs
3. Exploring other types of verifications beyond Google accounts
